# Ego Is the Enemy  
**Author:** Ryan Holiday

## Highlights

---

- I’ve found that if you go looking you’ll find that history is also made by individuals who fought their egos at every turn, who eschewed the spotlight, and who put their higher goals above their desire for recognition

---

- The ego we see most commonly goes by a more casual definition: an unhealthy belief in our own importance

---

- In this way, ego is the enemy of what you want and of what you have: Of mastering a craft.

---

- ego inhibits true success by preventing a direct and honest connection to the world around us.

---

- If you start believing in your greatness, it is the death of your creativity

---

- suppress ego early before bad habits take hold,

---

- Ego is stolen. Confidence is earned

---

- It is poise, not pose.

---

- Almost universally, the kind of performance we give on social media is positive. It’s more “Let me tell you how well things are going. Look how great I am.” It’s rarely the truth: “I’m scared. I���m struggling. I don’t know.”

---

- In actuality, silence is strength—particularly early on in any journey.

---

- Talk depletes us. Talking and doing fight for the same resources

---

- Let the others slap each other on the back while you’re back in the lab or the gym or pounding the pavement. Plug that hole—that one, right in the middle of your face—that can drain you of your vital life force. Watch what happens. Watch how much better you get.

---

- Appearances are deceiving. Having authority is not the same as being an authority.
