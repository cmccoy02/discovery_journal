# Sun and Steel  
**Author:** Mishima, Yukio

## Highlights

---

- I could either cultivate that orchard to its capacity or leave it for the weeds to run riot in.

---

- Words are a medium that reduces reality to abstraction

---

-  If I had done so, my words would have lost their purity. I should have been violated by reality, and reality would have become inescapable.

---

- The exercise of the muscles elucidated the mysteries that words had made.

---

- For ideas are, in the long run, essentially foreign to human existence; and the body — receptacle of the involuntary muscles, of the internal organs and circulatory system over which it has no control — is foreign to the spirit, so that it is even possible for people to use the body as a metaphor for ideas, both being something quite alien to human existence as such.

---

- Little by little, I began to feel uncertain about the night

---

- The sun became associated with the main highway of my life. And little by little, it tanned my skin brown, branding me as a member of the other race.

---

- the steel restored the classical balance that the body had begun to lose, reinstating it in its natural form, the form that it should have had all along.

---

- Bulging muscles, a taut stomach, and a tough skin, I reasoned, would correspond respectively to an intrepid fighting spirit, the power of dispassionate intellectual judgement, and a robust disposition.

---

- Just as muscles slowly increase their resemblance to steel, so we are gradually fashioned by the world; 

---

- At such times, the strength was mine, and equally it was the steel’s. My sense of existence was feeding on itself.

---

- It was an attempt to reach the “ultimate sensation” that lies just a hairsbreadth beyond the reach of the senses.

---

- Why do we conceive the desire to give expression to things that cannot be said—and sometimes succeed? 

---

- The opponent and I dwelt in the same world. When I looked, the opponent was seen; when the opponent looked, I was seen;

---

- Ideas do not stare back

---

- no technique of action can become effective until repeated practice has drummed it into the unconscious areas of the mind.

---

- Pain, I came to feel, might well prove to be the sole proof of the persistence of consciousness within the flesh

---

- At the height of the fray, I found, the tardy process of creating muscle, whereby strength creates form and form creates strength, is repeated so swiftly that it becomes imperceptible to the eye

---

- The defeat of the foe occurs when he accommodates his form to the hollow in space that one has already marked out; at that moment, one’s own form must preserve a constant precision and beauty

---

- I lacked the physical courage to seek out suffering for myself, to take pain unto myself

---

- Yet my dreams became, at some stage, my muscles

---

- Thus I glimpsed from time to time another sun quite different from that by which I had been so long blessed, a sun full of the fierce dark flames of feeling, a sun of death that would never burn the skin yet gave forth a still stranger glow

---

- I knew, of course, that there are some truths in this world that one cannot see unless one unbends one’s posture. But such things could well be left to others.

---

- More than anything, I detested defeat
