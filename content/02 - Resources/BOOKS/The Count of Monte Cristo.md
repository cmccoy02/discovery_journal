# The Count of Monte Cristo  
**Author:** Alexandre Dumas

## Highlights

---

- He told himself it was the hatred of men and not the vengeance of God that had thrust him into this dark abyss. He doomed these unknown men to the most cruel torments his fiery imagination was capable of conjuring up, but, even so, the most awful of these torments seemed to him too mild and too short for them, for after the torment would come death, and in death they would find, if not repose, at all events that insensibility which so nearly resembles repose.

- captivity shared with another is but half captivity

---

- The sea is the cemetery of the Château d’If.

---

- And they all regarded with astonishment this man whose eye had recovered an intelligence and his body a vigour they were far from suspecting him to possess.

---

- Time which casts its mantle of moss on all things material, and its mantle of oblivion on all things mortal

---

- On his deathbed, when his mind had been given that lucidity that the near approach of death brings with it, this thought which had till then only been a superstition, became a conviction. The last words he spoke were: ‘Maximilian, it was Edmond Dantès!’ 

---

- A man who lives in such a world of poetry will grow weary of a monotonous passion such as ours

---

- together with a will as powerful as it is possible for a mind to possess which is encumbered by a body over which it has lost the power of compelling obedience.

---

- what is marvellous? That which we do not comprehend. What is truly desirable? That which we cannot have. Now to see things I cannot understand, to procure things impossible of possession, such is the plan of my life. I can realize it by two means: money and will

---

- Are you prepared to fight against our ill fortune, Valentine? Tell me, for this is what I have come to ask you.

---

- everything appears possible to the condemned man, to whom a miracle becomes an everyday occurrence when it is a question

---

- of saving his life

---

- what I admire is your way of being served without a question,

---

- Devoted hearts seek one another in time of danger, and, child though I was, I instinctively sensed that some great danger was hanging over our heads

---

- On arriving at the house, Morrel was not even out of breath, for love lends wings

---

- What I have loved most after you,  Mercédès, has been myself, that means to say, my dignity, the force that made me superior to all others. This force was life to me. You have broken it, and I must die!”

---

- As for Monte Cristo, his head was bowed, his arms hung listless. He was crushed under the weight of twenty-four years’ memories

---

- there are those who have suffered so much and yet have not succumbed to their sufferings, but instead have built up a new fortune on the ruins of their former happiness

---

- Monte Cristo pressed his hand to his forehead. What was passing through that mind heavy with terrible secrets? What was the angel of light, or the angel of darkness, saying to that implacable human mind? God alone knows.

---

- Then this man of iron felt his heart swelling within him, a burning flame seemed to rise in his throat, and from thence rush to his eyes; he bowed his head and wept. For a while nothing was heard in the room but weeping and sobbing; a sound that must have been sweet to the angels in Heaven!

---

- What I demand, madame, is that justice shall be done. My mission on earth is to punish,” he added with a fierce look in his eyes. “I should send the executioner to any other woman were she the Queen herself, but to you I am merciful! To you I say: ‘Madame, have you not put aside a few drops of the most potent, the swiftest, and deadliest poison?

---

- He, who had never felt compassion for anyone, decided to go to his father so that in his weakness he would have someone to whom he could relate his sufferings, someone with whom he could weep

- Delays only double grief when one has to part

- It takes a long time for eyes that are swollen with weeping to see clearly, and at first, perhaps, he did not comprehend this infinite mercy, but at length he took patience and waited
